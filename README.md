### Analyzing electrophysiological responses to artificial and natural stimuli

The organization of this repo is as follows.

`requirements.txt` contains a list of the python packages used in this code. It can be used to quickly establish a repo with the same version numbers.

`V4pyutils.py` and `V4pyutils_M4.py` contain many functions for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization which are called in the notebooks below.

The folder **Preprocess data** contains, yes, scripts for preprocessing. This includes binning spike times into binned spike rates and concatenating recording sessions.

Finally, all of the figures in the publication were created in the Jupyter notebooks in the **create_main_figures** folders.
